## Create wallet

### Install and run Vega Wallet

#### Download file

Download and save the zip file from Vega Wallet software [releases â†—](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vegawallet/releases/). Keep track of where you've saved the file, because that's where the command line interface will look for it.

Download `vegawallet-linux-amd64.zip` and unzip it

```bash
wget https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vegawallet/releases/download/v0.16.1/vegawallet-linux-amd64.zip
unzip vegawallet-linux-amd64.zip
```

YOU MAY NEED TO CHANGE YOUR SYSTEM PREFERENCES TO RUN THE FILE

```bash
chmod +x vegawallet
```

### Generate new wallet

#### Initialise the software

The `init` command will initialise the software the first time you use it. This creates the folders and the configuration files needed by the software to operate.

```bash
./vegawallet init
```

#### Create your wallet

Next, create a wallet by giving it **a name and passphrase**.

This step will:

- create your first public and private key
- show your wallet's recovery phrase (save this immediately)

Replace `MY_WALLET_NAME` (below) with your chosen wallet name:

```bash
./vegawallet create --wallet "MY_WALLET_NAME"
```

It will then prompt you to **input a passphrase**, and then **confirm that passphrase**. You'll use this wallet name and passphrase to login to the token site and Vega Console.

> Warning
>
> Keep your recovery phrase safe and secret. You will need it to import your keys.
>
> **Your recovery phrase is only shown once ever and cannot be recovered. DO NOT SHARE YOUR RECOVERY PHRASE**.

### Choose a network

If you want to interact with the Token dApp or Vega Console, you'll need to import network configuration for the network(s) you want to connect to.

#### Import networks
Import the following network configurations:

- Mainnet network (run by validators): [mainnet1.toml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vegaprotocol/networks/master/mainnet1/mainnet1.toml)
- Fairground network: [fairground.toml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vegaprotocol/networks-internal/main/fairground/vegawallet-fairground.toml)

> INFO
> 
> To update your networks list, see [manage networks](https://docs.vega.xyz/mainnet/tools/vega-wallet/cli-wallet/latest/guides/manage-networks#update-networks) for instructions.

#### Import networks from URL

Use the following command to import from URL.

The URL used below is for mainnet, update the URL if you want to import a different network.

```bash
./vegawallet network import \
  --from-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vegaprotocol/networks/master/mainnet1/mainnet1.toml
```

#### Import networks from file

Alternatively you can import a network list from a text file. You can use the '.toml' files linked above as a template for your networks list. Use the following command to import from file:

```bash
./vegawallet network import --from-file "PATH_TO_FILE"
```

> INFO
> 
> Each network has a default name. You can rename the network using the `--with-name` flag.

#### List imported networks

To see the names of the networks you imported, run the following command:

```bash
./vegawallet network list
```
